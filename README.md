# Java-Discord-Bot
This is a straitly simple music bot that will infinitely play any audiofiles specified in resourses.
How it works: you need to be connected to any audiochannel on server with this bot and make a call for bot to play,
then he will jump in your audio channel (or send you a message that you are not connected to any) and will play selected music as long as you will keep staying connected,
or untill room will become empty.
